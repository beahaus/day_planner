# Day Planner

We were tasked with creating a day planner that will allow for use of moments.js, and allow the user to save items in the local storage so that upon reloading the webpage, their tasks would still show.

## Technology Used

- Twitter's Bootstrap Framework for the creation of the outline and buttons
- Moment.js for the use of color coding the hours the current hour, past hours, and future hours
- local storage for the user to input and receive data even after the user has reloaded the page
